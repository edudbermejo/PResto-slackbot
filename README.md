#### PRESTO-SLACKBOT!

Hi, I am a bot designed for helping your team list the Pull Requests that are opened for you. I can be on service under several commands:
* `/watchrepo <repository-name>` will add a repository to the list of watched ones for your channel.
* `/unwatchrepo <repository-name>` will delete a repository from the list of watched ones for your channel.
* `/listprs` will list all the PRs that are opened for your channel, though it won't show the ones that present merge conflicts or the lables `WIP` or `donotmerge`

Furthermore I am programmed to list all the PRs pending for your team at 9:30 (Ireland and NY time).
