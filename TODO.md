### Evolve
  * You register PResto inside a channel and you tell him what repos to watch.
  * At certain times it goes there and check what opened request are there without the label _WIP_ and _donotmerge_. (green for already approved, orange for not reviewed yet and red for ones with unresolved comments)
  * You can also request it to be done anytime using /listprs
  * Add an unsuscribe method. Maybe a check under add to be sure the repository is correctly written and it does exist?
  * Add a command to see what repos are being watched by the channel right now
